# HKN Mu Nu Chapter

## Who we are
We are the first European chapter of IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), at Politecnico di Torino.

## What is IEEE-HKN
IEEE-HKN (formerly HKN) is the honor society of IEEE. It's a rank organization that recognises excellence among peers, encourages individual eminence in education and meritorious work in professional practice. HKN is founded in October 1904 by Maurice L. Carr at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

## "HKN"
The Greek letters ΗΚΝ are chosen from the first, fourth, and last letter of the the Greek ἤλεκτρον (élektron, “amber”), the etymological root for the English word “electricity”.

## What we do
Our activities range from educational tutoring to the organization of events such as workshops and seminars, with the aim of improving our skills and helping out our colleagues.

## Some numbers
IEEE-HKN is a vibrant active organization with 243 chapters worldwide, over 4,000 current student members, more than 8,000 active IEEE members, and nearly 32,000 alumni spanning the ten Regions of the IEEE. IEEE-HKN remains the only engineering society with international chapters, and it has inducted over 200,000 members since its inception.
